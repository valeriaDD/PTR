Language of choice: **SCALA**

This is the laboratory work project for **Real Time Programming** course
that consists of several tasks divided in weeks.

Reports for each week are stored [here](src/reports)!

### W1 - Welcome...

* **Minimal Tasks**: 
    * Follow an installation guide to install the language / development environment of your choice.
    * Write a script that would print the message “Hello PTR” on the screen.
      Execute it.


* **Main Tasks**
  * Initialize a VCS repository for your project. Push your project to a remote repo.


* **Bonus Tasks**
  * Write a comprehensive readme for your repository.
  * Create a unit test for your project. Execute it.

### W2 - ...to the rice fields

* **Minimal Tasks**:
    * Write a function to calculate the area of a cylinder, given it’s height and
      radius.
    * Write a function to reverse a list.
    * Write a function to calculate the sum of unique elements in a list.
    * Write a function that extracts a given number of randomly selected elements
      from a list.
    * Write a function that returns the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence.
    * Write a function that, given a dictionary, would translate a sentence. Words
      not found in the dictionary need not be translated.
    * Write a function that receives as input three digits and arranges them in an
      order that would create the smallest possible number. Numbers cannot start with a 0.
    * Write a function that would rotate a list n places to the left.
    * Write a function that lists all tuples $a, b, c$ such that $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$ and $a, b  \le 20$* 
  

* **Main Tasks**
  * Write a function that eliminates consecutive duplicates in a list
  * Write a function that, given an array of strings, will return the words that can
    be typed using only one row of the letters on an English keyboard layout.
  * Create a pair of functions to encode and decode strings using the Caesar cipher.
  * White a function that, given a string of digits from 2 to 9, would return all
    possible letter combinations that the number could represent (think phones with buttons).
  * White a function that, given an array of strings, would group the anagrams
    together.


* **Bonus Tasks**
    * Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst a list of
      strings.
    * Write a function to convert arabic numbers to roman numerals.
    * Write a function to calculate the prime factorization of an integer.
